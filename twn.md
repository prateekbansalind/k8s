### Lesson 13
- Set network rules in the Network Security Group (NSG) for Kubernetes.
- Map IP addresses of machines to their desired names using the `/etc/hosts` file and the `hostnamectl set-hostname` utility.
- Refer to the [Kubernetes Installation Guide using kubeadm](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/) for more details.

---

### Lesson 14
- Completed the initial setup and installed applications necessary to set up the Kubernetes cluster.
- Covered the following concepts:
  - Container Runtime Interface (CRI)
  - Docker Shim
  - containerd
- Refer to the [Container Runtime Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/#installing-runtime) for additional information.

---

### Lesson 15
- Installed `containerd` on both the master and worker nodes.

---

### Lesson 16
- Installed `kubeadm`, `kubectl`, and `kubelet` on both the master and worker nodes.

---

### Lesson 17
- Explored how the `kubeadm init` command functions and reviewed the logs it generates.
- Examined important directories and files:
  - `/etc/kubernetes/manifests`
  - `/etc/kubernetes/pki`
- Analyzed the configuration files for `kube-apiserver` and `etcd`.

---

### Lesson 18
- Learned how to connect to the `kube-apiserver` using `kubectl` with different kubeconfig files:
  - `/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf`
  - `$HOME/.kube/config`
- Discussed users and contexts in the kubeconfig file and the use of certificates for authentication within the Kubernetes cluster.

---

### Lesson 19
- Explored Kubernetes Namespaces and their use cases:
  - Blue/Green deployments
  - Staging and development environments
  - Shared resources management
- Noted that ConfigMaps and Secrets are namespace-scoped and cannot be shared across namespaces.
- Observed that volumes are globally discoverable and not confined to namespaces.

---

### Lesson 20
- Continued discussion on Namespaces, including the `kube-system` namespace and its significance.
